DTrace and DTraceToolkit presentation

# Description

This is a Sun Microsystems Finland 2006 presentation. The original message from June 2006:

I've been busy with DTrace and Solaris. In fact I was working in getting ready a DTrace presentation for Opensolaris/DTrace community: a generic workshop about DTrace and DTraceToolkit (DTT) - a simple introduction on the new dynamic tracing framework and as well a presentation of DTraceToolkit with real case examples.

You can call this the first version, many new things planned to be added here:
* DTrace/DTT for Database Administrators
* DTrace/DTT for Java Developers
* Other examples using DTT
* support for certain local groups: finnish, romanian, etc

The main point of this presentation was to bring to people's attention the toolkit: a big collection of D/sh/ksh scripts used to help you in troubleshooting and debug situations. Please feel free and reuse the presentation as you like. Im talking with Brendan to see if we can include it under the toolkit or find a better place for it.

I think it is very important that people understand what new tools, mechanisms Solaris 10 is providing. Working for Sun Microsystems Finland I must ensure that our local customer base does get the real signal about DTrace and how can they use DTrace in production systems. So here comes the point of presenting DTrace and DTraceToolkit.

Even if you are a bank, a telco, a software house or maybe a game company sooner or later you will have to observer closely your business and troubleshoot it when some things might not function correctly. Or better you have to look the entire system and see the entire stack how it functions... Years ago, call this the stone age, people used to simple restart applications or simple reboot the entire system when something was not properly functioning...In present we can still see such things happening. You have a choice using Solaris/DTrace to stop doing this and start understanding what's going on...

If you are in Finland and need to meet and talk about these things don't hesitate to contact me! Otherwise drop me an email, I really much appreciate your feedback.
